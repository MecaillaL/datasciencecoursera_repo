* Machine learning is the process whereby computers learn to make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.
* Unsupervised learning is the process of uncovering hidden patterns and structures from unlabeled data. 
* Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the values to be predicted are 
  already known, and a model is built with the aim of accurately predicting values of previously unseen data. 
  Supervised learning uses features to predict the value of a target variable, such as predicting a basketball player's position based on their points per game.


TYPES OF SUPERVISED:
1. CLASSIFICATION
2. REGRESSION
